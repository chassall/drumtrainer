# Drum Trainer

Twenty participants learned to play two drumming patterns (pattern 1: AABA, pattern 2: AAABAA) at three different tempos (fast: 150 bpm, medium: 100 bpm, slow: 60 bpm). ï»¿Responses were recorded using the f and j keys on a standard keyboard. Visual feedback in the form of a coloured disc coincided with each button press and indicated whether the response was early, on time, or late. Feedback was determined by comparing the response time, relative to the previous response, to a window around the target duration. The window was adapted trial-by-trial to ensure that roughly half the outcomes were "on time".
